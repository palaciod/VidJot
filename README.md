# VidJot
This is a Node/Express app for jotting down ideas for future YoutTube ideas

### The VidJot Server and Web App

VidJot helps you jot down video ideas when there are no writing utensils in sight.


## Languages: 
1. Swift

#### What can the app do?
1. I use passport.js to authenticate users with a local strategy located in the mongo cluster.
2. Allow users to post a video idea and list them in a collection view.
3. Ability to edit and delete each post.
4. A sidebar that is just a UIView that holds a logout button.
